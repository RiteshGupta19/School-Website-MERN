It plays a vital role in the development of personality. It develops confidence also and helps us to become a responsible citizen of the nation. Children are the future of our nation. They learn that what is being taught since childhood. They should be encouraged to study and get a better education. Education is an essential component in a child's life as it enhances their skill, personality and attitude. It is rightly said that "education is the foundation upon which we build our future". We all parents want to see our kids getting success in life which is possible only through good education.`,

  body:`Susanskar English Medium School is established with vision to provide a friendly, nurturing and positive environment where children feel safe, enjoy their childhood, acheive their potential with strong ethical moral values. Along with imparting well designed & thought provoking education Susanskar School pays due attention to the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual development of their students. The school strives hard to encompass the prescribed syllabi of Maharashtra State Board as well as a curriculum that lies beyond the classroom education for upliftment of our students to the competitive challenges of future. I hope that our students will excel in every sphere of life and thereby making their parents, school and the Nation proud.

  With Best Wishes!`,

Good education, constantly inspire children to be self discipline and conscienctious to maximise success and maintain the momentum. “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination”, said Albert Einstein, a great inspiration in the world of science”. May God ignite the young minds, bless them with wisdom and love for knowledge, desire to create and realize their potential and be innovative.`,
